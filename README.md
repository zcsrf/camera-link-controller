# camera-link-controller

This repository contains the draft of the website to remote control a camera.

The website uses the ImageCapture Web API to get access to Video Capture USB device on the client.

Currently the website is to be hosted on the client device using node.js, this allows the user to control what stream it wants to see. The user can also host it on a small device like ESP8266 or similar, we just needs to be able to switch the RCA connection to a different source.

The user can capture frames and record small clips.
